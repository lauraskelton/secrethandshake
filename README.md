Hacker Schooler Detector for iOS

Each user’s phone emits an iBeacon signal that includes their userID. Each phone also scans for other signals, and if it finds that of another Hacker Schooler’s phone, it sends an alert to the scanner’s phone and downloads a profile photo, name, and batch of the nearby person.

That way, you could make sure to stop by and chat with that person at a conference or meetup.

Beta Testing
===========
So far it seems to be working well, but I definitely need beta testing help from some other Hacker School folks who wouldn’t mind giving some feedback. I have it up on TestFlight if you have an iPhone and time to test it out! http://tflig.ht/1stcVLG
